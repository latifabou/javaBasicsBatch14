Type casting(only for primitives) is converting one data type to another data type
for example we can convert a short to byte a long to float etc.
There are two main type casting:
-Implicit/automatic/widening:when Java converts a data type for, it only happens when we assign
a smaller data type to a larger data type. Because there is no data loss in this conversion.
-Explicit/manual/narrowing: when we convert a larger data type to a small data type. we have
to do explicitly or manually.
Why we should learn about type casting?
when we write code in our real life, most of the time, we use other people'code to save time
and we might also need to convert the data type to make our code compatible with their code.
What is the syntax of type casting?
we use() and inside the()we write the destination data type.
for example:
 long var1=250;
 int var2=(int)var1;// it's explicit/manual/narrowing
 double var3=var2;// it't implicit/automatic/widening

 float f=250.5f;
 double d=f//it't implicit/automatic/widening

 If else conditions:help us write code that can take the decision based on data.
 Why we should learn about if else?
  Because, when we are solving a real life problem like testing a website our programs need to make
 a lot of decisions
 if(the given username and password matches)(go to the home page)else(give user a warning).
 if(video is freezing)System.out.println("stop the video") else (keep the video).
 What is the syntax for if else conditions?
 boolean isHungry=true;
 if(isHungry)
 {System.out.prinln("please eat something")
 }else
 {System.out.println("lest's build some java programs")
 }
